                        Hello! If you want to know more about me, then keep
                        reading. Otherwise, feel free to hit that back button or
                        close your browser. You have been warned...

                        My name is Brandt Strom, but considering the large
                        header on this page you probably already knew that. What
                        you probably do NOT know, is that I am a 29 year old
                        Norwegian strawberry currently living in Redmond, WA. My
                        wife, Rachel, and I have lived in the same two bedroom
                        apartment for about 5 years now. We hope to own a home
                        some day, but the important details of 'where' and
                        'when' this will be are still unknown at this time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My history is not very exciting but I don't have any
                        complaints. I have two sisters and spent most of my
                        childhood living in Puyallup. I spent a lot of time
                        getting into trouble with friends and playing video
                        games. Soccer consumed many evenings and weekends, and I
                        still enjoy kicking a ball around to this day. After
                        graduating from high school, I moved to Ellensburg for 4
                        years where I attended Central Washington University. It
                        was there that I obtained a degree in Computer Science,
                        which allowed me to secure a software development
                        position in Redmond. I have been a software engineer for
                        almost 7 years now and I am excited to keep growing in
                        this field.

                        When I'm looking for something to do in my spare time, I
                        usually enjoy playing video games and catching up with
                        friends. I also enjoy listening to music and watching
                        movies with Rachel. When my neighbors are not home I
                        will occasionally use the opportunity to mess around on
                        my drum set. Additionally, I try to make an effort to
                        expand my knowledge on all things computers and
                        technology by watching videos and reading blogs and
                        articles.
