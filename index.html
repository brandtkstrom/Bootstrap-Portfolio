                    <p>Hello! If you want to know more about me, then keep reading. Otherwise, feel free to hit that
                        back button or close your browser. You have been warned... </p>
                    <p>My name is Brandt Strom, but considering the large header on this page you probably already knew
                        that. What you probably do NOT know, is that I am a 29 year old Norwegian strawberry currently
                        living in Redmond, WA. My wife, Rachel, and I have lived in the same two bedroom apartment for
                        about 5 years now. We hope to own a home some day, but the important details of 'where' and
                        'when' this will be are still unknown at this time.</p>
                    <p>My history is not very exciting but I don't have any complaints. I have two sisters and spent
                        most of my childhood living in Puyallup. I spent a lot of time getting into trouble with friends
                        and playing video games. Soccer consumed many evenings and weekends, and I still enjoy kicking a
                        ball around to this day. After graduating from high school, I moved to Ellensburg for 4 years
                        where I attended Central Washington University. It was there that I obtained a degree in
                        Computer Science, which allowed me to secure a software development position in Redmond. I have
                        been a software engineer for almost 7 years now and I am excited to keep growing in this field.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I'm looking for something to do in my spare time, I usually enjoy playing video games and
                        catching up with friends. I also enjoy listening to music and watching movies with Rachel. When
                        my neighbors are not home I will occasionally use the opportunity to mess around on my drum set.
                        Additionally, I try to make an effort to expand my knowledge on all things computers and
                        technology by watching videos and reading blogs and articles.</p>
